<p>Hi,<br />
I'm a new programmer, with two years of programming experience in school and two years of professional front end development.  
I'm still an amateur, and I won't sell myself as anything else.  However, all my life I've wanted to help others.
Programming has given me that outlit.  Now I'm looking to connect with organizations and individuals that strive to 
make this world a utopia.  Not through violence, but through education and empowerment. I'm done with the old and 
I'm ready for the new.
</p>
<p>
If you strive to help others and to engage in your community feel free to reach out to me.  
If you need a front end programmer for a project that stops wars, weapon manufactoring, helps veterans or for a million other 
reasons I can't even think of.  If you'd like to help me develop something beautiful that engages a peace loving community
reach out to me.
</p>
